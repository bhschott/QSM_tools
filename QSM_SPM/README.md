The script `fade_qsm_mvssm_spm` automates the processing pipeline for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) data using SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping). This pipeline involves creating Macro-Vessel-Suppressed Susceptibility Maps (MVSSM), generating binary masks, converting images to integer format, masking images, and performing SPM normalization and smoothing. The script processes QSM images for multiple subjects organized in a specified directory structure.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - Defines user-specific parameters such as volume name (`volname`), scanner name (`scanner_name`), and various directory paths.
   - Determines the appropriate DICOM directory based on the scanner name.
   - Sets filenames and parameters for QSM processing, including standard deviation cutoff, full-width half-maximum (FWHM) for smoothing, and scaling factors.

2. **Loop Over Subjects**:
   - Iterates through each subject directory, processing QSM images for each subject.
   - For each subject, the script performs the following steps:

3. **QSM Image Copying**:
   - Copies high and low lambda QSM images to the subject's SPM directory.

4. **MVSSM Calculation**:
   - Calls `fade_qsm_calculate_mvssm` to generate the Macro-Vessel-Suppressed Susceptibility Map (MVSSM) using the high and low lambda QSM images.
   - The function applies a standard deviation cutoff and smoothes the images before calculating the MVSSM.

5. **Mask Creation**:
   - Calls `fade_qsm_create_mask` to create a binary mask from the high lambda QSM image.
   - This function iteratively smooths and binarizes the image to generate the mask.

6. **Integer Conversion**:
   - Calls `fade_qsm_convert_int16` to convert the MVSSM image to int16 format, applying a scaling factor.
   - This is necessary for SPM image calculationand coregistration, which cannot handle NIFTI images of different numeric formats.

7. **Masking MVSSM Image**:
   - Uses SPM's `imcalc` function to apply the binary mask to the int16 MVSSM image, producing a masked MVSSM image.

8. **SPM Normalization and Smoothing**:
   - Coregisters the subject's MPRAGE image with the masked MVSSM image using SPM.
   - Segments the coregistered MPRAGE image.
   - Normalizes the masked MVSSM image to MNI space using the deformation fields obtained from segmentation.
   - Applies two levels of Gaussian smoothing (4 mm and 6 mm FWHM) to the normalized MVSSM image.

9. **Error Handling**:
   - Catches any errors that occur during the processing of a subject and records the subject ID in an error log.

### Functions Used

1. **fade_qsm_calculate_mvssm**:
   - Generates the MVSSM image from high and low lambda QSM images.
   - Applies a standard deviation cutoff and smoothing to the images before calculating the MVSSM.

2. **fade_qsm_create_mask**:
   - Creates a binary mask from the high lambda QSM image.
   - Iteratively smooths and binarizes the image to generate a robust mask.

3. **fade_qsm_convert_int16**:
   - Converts the MVSSM image to int16 format.
   - Applies a scaling factor to maintain the dynamic range of the image.
